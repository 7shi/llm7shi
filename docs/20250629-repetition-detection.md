# Repetition Detection Algorithm Optimization

This document describes the optimization of the `detect_repetition` function in llm7shi, implemented on 2025-06-29.

## Background

Large language models occasionally get stuck in repetitive output loops, generating the same pattern repeatedly. This wastes tokens and provides poor user experience. The `detect_repetition` function identifies these patterns to enable early termination of generation.

## Original Algorithm

The original implementation checked all patterns from length 1 to `threshold` (default 200) sequentially:

```python
for pattern_len in range(1, threshold + 1):
    required_reps = _calculate_required_reps(pattern_len)
    # Check if text ends with pattern repeated required_reps times
```

This resulted in O(threshold × pattern_length) complexity, causing performance issues with large thresholds.

## Optimized Algorithm

The new implementation uses a two-phase approach that leverages mathematical properties of repetition patterns.

### Adaptive Threshold Calculation

The function now supports dynamic threshold calculation when no explicit threshold is provided:

```python
def detect_repetition(text: str, threshold: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    # Set default threshold based on text length
    if threshold is None:
        threshold = len(text) // 10
```

This adaptive approach ensures that:
- **Short texts** get proportionally smaller search windows, improving performance
- **Long texts** get larger search windows for comprehensive detection
- **Memory usage** scales appropriately with input size

### Phase 1: Short Patterns (1-10 characters)

For patterns of length 1-10, we use direct sequential checking with early termination:

```python
for pattern_len in range(1, min(10, threshold) + 1):
    required_reps = _calculate_required_reps(pattern_len)
    
    # Early termination when text is too short
    if pattern_len * required_reps > len(text):
        break
    
    pattern = text[-pattern_len:]
    if text.endswith(pattern * required_reps):
        return True
```

**Key optimization**: Since `pattern_len * required_reps` is monotonically increasing for patterns 1-10, we can break early when the text becomes too short.

#### Example: Pattern Length Requirements

| Pattern Length | Required Reps | Total Length |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1              | 100           | 100          |
| 2              | 54            | 108          |
| 3              | 38            | 114          |
| 4              | 31            | 124          |
| 5              | 26            | 130          |
| 6              | 23            | 138          |
| 7              | 20            | 140          |
| 8              | 18            | 144          |
| 9              | 17            | 153          |
| 10             | 16            | 160          |

### Phase 2: Long Patterns (11+ characters)

For patterns longer than 10 characters, we use an optimized search based on a key insight: **any repetition pattern longer than 10 characters must contain the last 10 characters of the text**.

```python
suffix_marker = text[-10:]  # Last 10 characters as a marker
min_search_pos = max(len(text) - 10 - threshold, 0)

search_end = len(text) - 10
while True:
    pos = text[:search_end].rfind(suffix_marker)
    
    if pos < min_search_pos:
        break
    
    candidate_pattern = text[pos + 10:]
    required_reps = _calculate_required_reps(len(candidate_pattern))
    
    if text.endswith(candidate_pattern * required_reps):
        return True
    
    search_end = pos
```

#### How It Works

1. **Extract suffix marker**: Take the last 10 characters of the text
2. **Search backwards**: Use `rfind` to locate previous occurrences of this marker
3. **Form candidate patterns**: For each occurrence at position `pos`, the candidate pattern is `text[pos + 10:]`
4. **Check repetition**: Test if the text ends with this pattern repeated the required number of times
5. **Respect threshold**: Stop searching beyond `len(text) - threshold - 10`

#### Example: Finding a 25-character Pattern

Given text ending with: `"...the quick brown fox jumps the quick brown fox jumps the quick brown fox jumps"`

1. **Suffix marker**: `"brown fox "` (last 10 chars)
2. **Find occurrences**: 
   - Position 55: Forms pattern `"brown fox jumps the quick "` (25 chars)
   - Position 30: Forms pattern `"brown fox jumps the quick brown fox jumps the quick "` (50 chars)
3. **Check repetitions**: Pattern at position 55 repeats 3 times, meeting the requirement

## Performance Comparison

### Example 1: Short Text (100 characters)
- **Old algorithm**: Checks patterns 1-100
- **New algorithm**: 
  - Adaptive threshold: 100 // 10 = 10
  - Checks patterns 1-10 only (Phase 1 early termination)
- **Improvement**: 90% reduction in iterations

### Example 2: Long Text (1000 characters) with no repetition
- **Old algorithm**: Checks all patterns 1-200
- **New algorithm**: 
  - Adaptive threshold: 1000 // 10 = 100
  - Phase 1: Checks patterns 1-10
  - Phase 2: Typically finds < 5 occurrences of suffix marker
- **Improvement**: ~95% reduction in iterations

### Example 3: Text with 50-character repetition pattern
- **Old algorithm**: Checks patterns 1-50 before finding match
- **New algorithm**: 
  - Adaptive threshold: Varies based on text length
  - Phase 1: Checks patterns 1-10 (no match)
  - Phase 2: Finds match in first occurrence of suffix marker
- **Improvement**: ~80% reduction in iterations

## Complexity Analysis

- **Old algorithm**: O(threshold × pattern_length)
- **New algorithm**: O(10) + O(occurrences × pattern_length)
  - Where `occurrences` is typically much smaller than `threshold`

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty suffix marker**: If all last 10 characters are identical (e.g., "aaaaaaaaaa"), `rfind` still works correctly
2. **Short texts**: Phase 1 handles texts shorter than 160 characters efficiently
3. **Threshold boundary**: `min_search_pos` calculation ensures we never check patterns longer than threshold
4. **No repetition**: Both phases terminate quickly without false positives

## Formula for Required Repetitions

The `_calculate_required_reps` function determines how many times a pattern must repeat to be considered a "stuck loop":

```python
def _calculate_required_reps(pattern_len: int) -> int:
    if pattern_len >= 31:
        return 10
    else:
        total_len = 100 + (pattern_len - 1) * 8
        return total_len // pattern_len
```

This formula ensures:
- Single character repetitions need 100 occurrences
- Longer patterns need proportionally fewer repetitions
- Patterns of 31+ characters need at least 10 repetitions

## Conclusion

This optimization significantly improves performance while maintaining the same detection accuracy. The two-phase approach efficiently handles both short and long repetition patterns, making the function suitable for real-time use during text generation.
