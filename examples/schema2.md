# schema2.py - Pydantic Schema Example

## Why This Example Exists

This example demonstrates the advantages of using Pydantic models for schema definition in modern Python development.

### Type-Safe Schema Definition
**Problem**: JSON Schema files are external, untyped, and don't provide IDE support or compile-time validation. They're error-prone and harder to maintain in larger codebases.

**Solution**: Uses Pydantic models with Python type hints, providing IDE auto-completion, type checking, and better integration with modern Python development workflows.

### Developer Experience Priority
**Problem**: Writing and maintaining JSON Schema files manually is tedious and error-prone, especially for complex nested structures.

**Solution**: Demonstrates how Python classes with type hints can automatically generate schemas while providing better tooling support, making structured LLM output more accessible to Python developers.

### Pydantic Integration with Quality Patterns
**Problem**: Developers want to benefit from both modern Python tooling (type hints, IDE support) and proven structured output quality patterns (like reasoning fields).

**Solution**: Shows how Pydantic models seamlessly integrate with established schema design patterns (see [schema1.md](schema1.md)). The same reasoning-first, item-level approach that improves output quality in JSON schemas works naturally with Pydantic models, allowing developers to maintain both type safety and output reliability without choosing between modern tooling and proven patterns.
