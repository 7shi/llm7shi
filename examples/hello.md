# hello.py - Basic Text Generation Example

## Why This Example Exists

This example demonstrates the core design philosophy of llm7shi - **simplicity by default**.

### Minimal API Surface
**Problem**: Many LLM libraries require complex configuration and setup for basic text generation, creating barriers for new users and simple use cases.

**Solution**: A single function call with sensible defaults that "just works" - import one function, pass a prompt, get output with streaming, thinking process, and error handling automatically included.
