# compat0.py - Multi-Provider Hello World Example

## Why This Example Exists

This example demonstrates the core value proposition of the compatibility layer - vendor neutrality.

### Provider Independence Philosophy
**Problem**: Applications tied to specific LLM providers face vendor lock-in, making it difficult to compare models, implement fallbacks, or optimize costs across providers.

**Solution**: Shows how the same code can run on different LLM providers without changes, enabling provider flexibility and reducing vendor dependency.

### Unified Interface Benefits
**Problem**: Each LLM provider has different APIs, parameter names, and calling conventions, requiring developers to learn multiple APIs and maintain provider-specific code.

**Solution**: Demonstrates a single function that abstracts provider differences while preserving the ability to specify which model to use, simplifying multi-provider applications.
