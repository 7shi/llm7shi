# compat0.py - Multi-Provider Hello World Example

## Why This Example Exists

This example demonstrates the core value proposition of the compatibility layer - vendor neutrality.

### Provider Independence Philosophy
**Problem**: Applications tied to specific LLM providers face vendor lock-in, making it difficult to compare models, implement fallbacks, or optimize costs across providers.

**Solution**: Shows how the same code can run across cloud-based APIs (Gemini, OpenAI) and local models (Ollama) without changes, enabling provider flexibility and reducing vendor dependency.

### Unified Interface Benefits
**Problem**: Each LLM provider has different APIs, parameter names, and calling conventions, requiring developers to learn multiple APIs and maintain provider-specific code.

**Solution**: Demonstrates a single function that abstracts provider differences across three different backends while preserving the ability to specify which model to use, simplifying multi-provider applications.

### Local vs Cloud Model Comparison
**Problem**: Developers need to evaluate trade-offs between cloud-based models (performance, latest features) and local models (privacy, offline capability, cost control).

**Solution**: Provides direct comparison by running the same prompt across both cloud providers (Gemini, OpenAI) and local deployment (Ollama), making differences in response style and capabilities immediately visible.
